<h2>Hey 👋, I'm Gabe</h2>
<p>
Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm an emerging tech enthusiast with a passion for data and automation. My journey in the tech world is just beginning, but I'm eager to dive deep and explore the endless possibilities.

🔍 What I'm Focused On:

    SQL and Databases: I am fascinated by the power of data management and have been working with SQL through platforms like MySQL and SQLite. My repositories showcase my growing expertise in crafting efficient and effective queries, demonstrating my understanding of database fundamentals.

    Python Programming: Python is my go-to language for most of my projects. Its versatility allows me to experiment with various aspects of programming, from data manipulation to automation.

    Automation with Selenium: I've dabbled in automation, primarily using Selenium. It's an area I find intriguing and am actively exploring. I plan to share my projects on this front soon.

    Version Control with Git: I believe in the importance of efficient version control, and I'm honing my skills in using Git. It's a journey of continuous learning and improvement.

🌱 My Learning Path:

    I am relatively new to the world of databases and queries, but I am committed to learning and growing in this field. My approach is hands-on, and I believe in learning by doing. I regularly update my repositories with what I learn, hoping to not only track my progress but also to showcase my growing skill set.

👀 Looking Forward:

    My current goal is to deepen my understanding of database management and query optimization. I am also working on a project involving Python and Selenium, focusing on automation, which I will be sharing here soon.

📚 My Repositories:

    Feel free to explore my repositories where I've put my SQL queries and Python scripts. Each project is a step forward in my learning journey.

🤝 Let's Connect:

    I'm always open to collaborating on projects and exchanging knowledge with fellow tech enthusiasts.
    If you have any advice, project ideas, or just want to chat about technology, feel free to reach out!

    Thank you for visiting my profile. Let's delve into the world of data and automation together!
